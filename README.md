# Learning C language

## Learn how to run the code first

1. you have to compile the code using "clang" for mac -- "clang program.c -o program_name"
2. you have to execute the file using "./program_name.c"
3. you did it!

## Print Statements

1. printf is the standard here unlike "print" in python.
2. everything have to end in ";".
3. to end the function here they use " return 0;" cause C lang expects to return some value.

## Variables

````c

```c
int main(){
